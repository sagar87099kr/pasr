If you do not agree, you must immediately stop using the Platform. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you (“User”) and [PASR.IN].
<br>
<b> Nature of Our Role </b><br>

PASR.IN operates as an intermediary platform that connects Users seeking services with independent third-party service providers (“Providers”). We do not own, manage, or control the services offered by Providers. All services displayed on our Platform are offered directly by third-party Providers, and our role is limited to providing a digital interface where Users and Providers may connect.
We do not guarantee, endorse, or recommend any specific Provider.
Our company is trying to verify as much as possible but not completely. We do not control the quality, safety, legality, or availability of services offered by Providers.
We are not a party to any contract or agreement made between Users and Providers.
<p></p>

All financial transactions are strictly between the User and the Provider.
The Company shall not be held responsible for delays, non-performance, disputes, or fraudulent acts related to payments.
Refunds, cancellations, and rescheduling policies are determined solely by the Provider. Users are responsible for reviewing such policies before making a payment.

<b>Disclaimer of Liability </b> <br>

The Company provides the Platform “as-is” and “as-available.” We expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied, regarding the Platform or services offered by Providers.
