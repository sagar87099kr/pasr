                <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 21 January 2026</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how PASR (Perfectly Short Service and Rentals) (“PASR,”
                    “we,” “us,” “our”) collects, uses, discloses, retains, and safeguards information in connection with

                <h4>1. SCOPE AND APPLICATION</h4>
                <p>This Policy applies to visitors, customers, and service providers. It does not govern third parties.

                <h4>2. PLATFORM CHARACTERIZATION</h4>
                <p>PASR is a discovery and listing platform. We do not render services, guarantee performance, or act as

                <h4>3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
                <p>We collect information you submit (contact details, inquiries, profile info) and automatically
                    collected data (device IDs, logs, location). Location data is used to provide proximity results.</p>

                <h4>6. DATA RETENTION & SECURITY</h4>
                <p>We retain data as needed and implement safeguards, though no system is 100% secure.</p>
