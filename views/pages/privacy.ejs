            <p class="legal-text">
                PASR operates as a location-based, schedule-forward discovery and listing platform intended to
                facilitate identification of Providers and display of Provider-declared availability. PASR does not (a)
                render services itself, (b) guarantee Provider performance, quality, or availability, or (c) act as an
                agent, broker, or fiduciary of any Customer or Provider, except to the extent required by applicable
                law.
            </p>
            <p class="legal-text">
                Bookings and commercial arrangements typically occur off-platform and directly between Customers and
                Providers.
